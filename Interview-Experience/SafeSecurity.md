12. Create an interactive 3x3 grid (9 boxes) where the user can click on any box to fill it with a color (e.g., blue), allowing up to 8 boxes to be colored in any order; on the 9th click, regardless of which box is clicked, the grid should reset all colors back to the original uncolored state, and the counting restarts allowing the process to repeat indefinitely. The grid should not indicate or reserve any specific box as a reset triggerâ€”instead, the reset happens strictly after the ninth click by the user, making every click equally significant.
